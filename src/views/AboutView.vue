  <div class="about">
    <p class="about-text">Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton developed by John Conway in 1970. It's an example I like to use when learning more technologies because the core loop is very easy to throw together. You can read more about it in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of Life</a> Wikipedia article. This site was built as a small educational project while learning VueJS. It's powered, of course, by VueJS and hosted on Github. You can find the repo <a href="https://github.com/timothyjrogers/conwaydemo">here</a>.</p>
